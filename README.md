This repo is for a Numerical Analysis project

## Running

- Make sure you have completed the requirements section below
- To show and listen to the sample type `py ./src/drivers/show_graph.py {SAMPLE_NAME}`
- To run the upscaler type `py ./src/upscaler.py {SAMPLE_NAME}` and it will generate an upscaled file in samples for you to calle the show graph on.

## Requirements

- Make a virtual Environment with `py -m venv .venv`
- To activate Vitual Environment: `./.venv/Scripts/activate`
- Install all the Required Dependencies in the Vitual Environment: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
